# 2048 Game
2048 is a game and you are expected to implement the move function for this game.
Arguments passed to the four functions is the matrix which we are using for 2048
The move function will be returning new matrix after moving the corresponding move.
Implement All The Four Moves Using These Functions -
1. move_up
2. move_down
3. move_left
4. move_right

Go to main file i.e 2048.py
In cmd add the directory folder and then run this python file.
eg-c\users\xyzname>python 2048.py
The UI will look like 4X4 grid

How to play the game:
The rules are also simple. You just need to move the tiles and every time you move one, another tile pops up in a random manner anywhere in the box. When two tiles with the same number on them collide with one another as you move them, they will merge into one tile with the sum of the numbers written on them initially.

Note:Works well in windows or Python 3
For MAC please go to 2048.py and change "tkinter" to "Tkinter" or Python 2 and enjoy!
eg-c\users\xyzname>python2 2048.py
